Computers are getting better at figuring out things about people, like how old they are and whether they are male or female. They use special programs to look at pictures and learn from them. For example, if you show the computer lots of pictures of people and tell it how old they are and if they are a man or a woman, it can learn to guess the age and gender of new people in other pictures. This can be useful in different areas like advertising, healthcare, and security. However, we need to be careful and make sure these computer programs are fair and don't make mistakes. It's important to use this technology in a good and responsible way
